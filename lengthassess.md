Assessing fish stock status is always challenging, but this is especially true for reef fish without catch/effort data. A promising approach is to combine length measurements with life history parameters. Together with the REEF Grouper Moon Project and Cayman Islands DOE scientists, we are using diver-operated laser calipers to obtain lengths from the Nassau Grouper spawning aggregation on Little Cayman Island. We hope that lessons learned from this study are applicable to other aggregating fish stocks without catch or effort data.
