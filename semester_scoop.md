Dear Visitor,

Welcome to my graduate school journey page! 
Here, I'll be sharing regular updates on my progress, semester by semester, as I pursue my graduate studies.
- I will outline my semester goals and accomplishments related to my graduate assistantship. **I am working on expanding the open-source ecosystem around the data.table package, a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).** I began this project in August 2023, when I started my graduate program.

# FALL 2023

## Semester Goals
 - Examine data.table repository, including issues about performance regressions, to create five new relevant performance tests, and use atime to analyze three different code branches (before regression, regression, fix regression) and create github action for performance testing, which is run for every Pull request. 
 - Utilize the atime package to generate figures that demonstrate the efficiency of the data.table package in comparison to other Python packages such as pandas.
 - Improve data.table to make two educational resources like blog posts or videos to teach users how to use data.table effectively.
 - Create slides and present results in machine learning group meeting.
