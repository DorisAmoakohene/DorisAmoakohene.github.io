Dear Visitor,

Welcome to my graduate school journey page! Here, I'll be sharing regular updates on my progress, semester by semester, as I pursue my graduate studies.
I will outline my semester goals and accomplishments related to my graduate assistantship. I am working on expanding the open-source ecosystem around the data.table package, a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). I began this project in August 2023, when I started my graduate program.
