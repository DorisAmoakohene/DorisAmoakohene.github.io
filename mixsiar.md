MixSIAR is an open-source R package ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MixSIAR), [GitHub](https://brianstock.github.io/mixsiar)) that helps you create and run Bayesian mixing models to analyze biotracer data (i.e. stable isotopes, fatty acids), following the MixSIAR model framework.

MixSIAR represents a collaborative coding project between the investigators behind MixSIR and SIAR: Brice Semmens, Brian Stock, Andrew Jackson, Eric Ward, Andrew Parnell, Donald Phillips, Richard Inger, and Stuart Bearhop.

### Why use MixSIAR?

1. Consumer variability via covariate effects (i.e. allow consumers to not all have the same diet)
2. Source uncertainty (fits source data within model, i.e. admit the *sample mean* is not the truth)
3. Better error structures (see [Stock and Semmens 2016](/pdf/Stock_Semmens_2016_unifying_error_structures.pdf))
4. Construct informative priors
5. Graphical User Interface (GUI) and script versions

These [presentation slides](/pdf/mixsiar_sioSIgroup_052217.pdf) illustrate the above points with examples.
