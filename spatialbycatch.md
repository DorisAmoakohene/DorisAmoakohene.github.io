Bycatch is an important concern in many fisheries. "Dynamic management" is a recently proposed approach to reduce bycatch, where maps of bycatch risk hotspots are updated at high frequency (real-time, daily, weekly, etc.). Together with Eric Ward (NWFSC) and Tomo Eguchi (SWFSC), I have been testing how well different "species distribution models" predict bycatch:
  - GLM
  - GAM 
  - GMRF (INLA-SPDE)
  - Random forest

This work is still in progress, but I have presented preliminary findings at:

[Predicting fisheries bycatch risk for dynamic spatial management](/pdf/PSAW_011917_SpatialBycatch_Stock.pdf) - National Protected Species Assessment Workshop - AFSC - Jan 2017

[What spatial statistical model is best for predicting fisheries bycatch risk?](/pdf/Stock_bycatch_091117.pdf) - Applied math seminar - Claremont Colleges - Sept 2017
