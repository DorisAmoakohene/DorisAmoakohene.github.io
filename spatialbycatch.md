Bycatch is an important concern in many fisheries. "Dynamic management" is a recently proposed approach to reduce bycatch, where maps of bycatch risk hotspots are updated at high frequency (real-time, daily, weekly, etc.). Together with researchers at the NWFSC (Eric Ward, Jim Thorson, Jason Jannot) and SWFSC (Tomo Eguchi), I have been testing how well different "species distribution models" predict bycatch:
  - GLM
  - GAM 
  - GMRF (INLA-SPDE)
  - Random forest

This work is still in progress, but I have presented preliminary findings at:
