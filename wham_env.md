Stock assessment models use data from biological studies, surveys, and fisheries to estimate fish population
(stock) status and sustainable harvest levels. Single-species assessments are based on internal population
dynamics and traditionally have not considered effects of the environment or interactions with other species,
even though fisheries scientists have long known that they are important drivers of time-varying population
processes, e.g. recruitment, mortality, growth, and movement. The last two decades have increasingly seen a push 
for more holistic, ecosystem-based fisheries management. In part, this is a recognition 
that considering single species in isolation produces riskier and less robust outcomes long-term. In several high-profile cases,
fisheries management has failed to prevent collapses because they did not reduce fishing pressure in responses
to changes in natural mortality, recruitment, and migration patterns caused by dynamics external to the stock in
question (e.g. Northern cod, Gulf of Maine cod, Pacific sardine). This is particularly concerning in the context of 
climate change and the wide range of biological processes integrated in stock assessments that are likely to be affected. 
Thus, while building environmental effects into stock assessments is compelling, this must be done
with thorough consideration for uncertainty in model structure and how it impacts performance of the
management system.

Dr. Tim Miller (NEFSC) and I are contributing to this effort by extending single-species state-space assessment models to
incorporate environmental effects on life history attributes. We are developing a general framework and open-source software
package, [wham](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham).
