### Medical Innovation Lab 
Most of my work has been collaborating with Pharmacists and Clinicians under Adam Bress, PharmD. Some of my recent works as lead/secondary analyst or co-first author are on: 

- Estimating the Per-protocol effect of initiation and continuous treatment with angiotensin-II receptor blockers versus angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on
cognitive outcomes in SPRINT 
- Estimating the intent-to-treat effect of initiating an ACEI vs. ARB on cardiovascular disease outcomes among SPRINT and ACCORD-eligible US adults
- Evaluating the association of genetic ancestry with cardiovascular disease among African Americans: Findings from the Jackson Heart Study and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohorts
- Evaluating the distribution of predicted cardiovascular and all-cause mortality benefit of intensive vs standard blood pressure control among SPRINT-eligible US adults
- Evaluating the Factors Associated with Antihypertensive Monotherapy Among US Adults with Treated Hypertension and Uncontrolled Blood Pressure Overall and by Race/Ethnicity, NHANES 2013-2018
- Evaluating the association between living in a pharmacy desert and cardiovascular disease events and blood pressure control among those with treated hypertension in the REGARDS study
