- I developed this package for my CS 599 class. [CS599Kmeans.DAA](https://github.com/DorisAmoakohene/K-means-Pkg-for-CS599) is an R package that provides an implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm.This package offers efficient and customizable functions for performing K-means clustering on datasets, allowing users to specify the number of clusters and various initialization methods

- I developed [CS599.pca.ADA](https://github.com/DorisAmoakohene/R-Package-Proj-for-CS599-final), comprehensive package designed specifically for the CS599 class, providing a wide range of functions for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and related tasks. The package aims to support users in performing various operations, including dimensionality reduction, data exploration, and model interpretation using PCA
