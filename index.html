<p>Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Ransmond Berchie, and I am a third-year Ph.D. Biostatistics student at the <a href='https://medicine.utah.edu/population-health-sciences'>Population Health Science Department</a> of University of Utah. I am currently working under <a href='https://medicine.utah.edu/population-health-sciences/dscharf'>Dr. Daniel Scharftein</a> on using EHR data of patients at-risk of sepsis to learn an optimal antibiotic initiation rule , and  under <a href='https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail/u0892412'>Dr. Yue Zhang</a>  on using clustering in semi-markov multi-state models to explore the impact of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) co-infection on the probability of progression to ICU care among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. I am broadly interested in causal inference, survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and pharmacoepidemiology.</p>

<p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from <a href='https://statacts.knust.edu.gh/'>Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology-Kumasi, Ghana (KNUST)</a>. Serving as a Teaching Assistant after my undergraduate study exposed me to numerous research experience which stirred up my interest in how I wanted to use statistics to solve real world problem. In view of that, I participated and presented my undergrdauted project at the <a href='https://events.nims.edu.gh/event/64/timetable/?view=standard'>Conference on Scientific Computing and Industrial Modeling</a>. This participation led to my first contribution to a publication with my supervisor on Modelling the force of infection for Hepatitis B among heterogeneous groups at the Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital.</p>

<p>After serving as a Teaching Assistant for one year at KNUST, I moved to <a href='https://nau.edu/math/'>Northern Arizona University (NAU)</a> for my Master's degree in Statistics. My graduate journey at NAU was coupled with teaching responsibilties which gave me the opportunity to impart knowledge and meet people with diverse background. I was awarded Carlson-Diekelman Rushall-Schroeder Memorial Endowed Scholarship for my dedication to teaching and excellence in class as a graduate student. As part of my graduate journey, I used machine learning techniques to predict heart disease, and also employed Bayesian approach to examine factors that strongly influence the presence of heart disease in patients. As a requirement for my master's degree, I also served as a consultant in the Statistical Consulting Lab of the Mathematics and Statistics Department where I provided statistical advice and research assistance to clients in the university community in support of their academic research.<p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy watching European football and watching drama and thriller series.<p>
