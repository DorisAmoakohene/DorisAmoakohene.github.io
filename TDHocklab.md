### Machine learning lab
Most of my work has been collaborating  Expanding the Opensource system around data.table in R

- Collaborator to the data.table open-source R package
- Performed performance testing and benchmarking for data.table on GitHub, identifying and implementing performance improvements.
- Assisted in develop a GitHub Action that runs on every pull request.
- Presented two talks:
  - Benchmarking Performance for the data.table package at the useR! 2024 conference
  - Optimizing data.table for Machine Learning, at the ASU Machine Learning Conference
-I examine data.table repository, including issues about performance regressions, to create relevant performance tests, and use atime to analyze three different code branches (before regression, regression, fix regression).
- Connect with data.table users and developers
