Much of the tremendous fluctuation in fish population sizes is due to variable conditions experienced by their tiny eggs and larvae--currents, food, and predator distributions. Fine-scale (1-10m) patchiness is likely important to egg and larval survival, but is impossible to resolve using traditional net sampling techniques. Thus, developing new tools capable of observing fish egg distributions at fine scales is important to our mechanistic understanding of why fish populations decline and recover.

Together with [Jules Jaffe's Lab](http://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu/), we are investigating how such fine-scale patchiness affects an endangered reef fish, Nassau Grouper (*Epinephelus striatus*) in the Cayman Islands. Nassau Grouper populations have drastically declined throughout the Caribbean, primarily due to overfishing at their spawning aggregations. The aggregation off Little Cayman Island is one of the largest remaining for the species, and has increased in size since protections took effect in 2003. Yet, it remains unclear if and how this increase in eggs will translate into further increases in adults. Mechanistic understanding of how eggs survive to become spawning adults will allow for appropriate management to help protect this species.

This work is still in progress, but I have presented preliminary results:
